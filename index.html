                <p class="text-justify term">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
                    industry.
                    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
                    type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also
                    the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
                    It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
                    containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
                    like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

                <h2 class="font-weight-bold">What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
                <p class="text-justify term2">It is a long established fact that a reader will
                    be distracted by the readable content of a page
                    when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem
                    Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution
                    of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content
                    here', making it look like readable English.
                    Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors
                    now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text,
                    and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web
                    sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved
                    over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
                    purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>

                <p class="text-justify term3">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not
                    simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
                    classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making
                    it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
                    professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
                    looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
                    consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
                    literature,discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and
                    1.10.33 of
                    "de
                    FinibuBonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book
                    is
                    a
                    treatise
                    on
                    the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem
                    ipsum
                    dolor
                    sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>

        <p>"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born
            and I
            will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer
            of
            the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,
            because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter
            consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to
            obtain
            pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain
            can
            procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious
            physical
            exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who
            chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no
            resultant pleasure?"</p>

                <p>"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled
                    and
                    demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot
                    foresee
                    the
                    pain
                    and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty
                    through
                    weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases
                    are
                    perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is
                    untrammelled
                    and
                    when
                    nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and
                    every
                    pain
                    avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of
                    business
                    it
                    will
                    frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man
                    therefore
                    always
                    holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other
                    greater
                    pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."</p>
